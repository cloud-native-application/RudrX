# Capability Documentation

> Note: All the contents under this directory are designed to be referenced by other documentations as the full schema or usage of specific workload types or traits. 

Learning the detailed schema of every [workload type](https://github.com/oam-dev/kubevela/tree/master/docs/en/developers/references/workload-types)
and [trait](https://github.com/oam-dev/kubevela/tree/master/docs/en/developers/references/traits) supported in KubeVela.

> In the upcoming releases, we plan to auto-generate all these reference documentations from the CUE templates in KubeVela's definition objects, and developers could read them by simply `$ vela show <trait_name>`.
