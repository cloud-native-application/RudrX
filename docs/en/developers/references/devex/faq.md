### Error: unable to create new content in namespace cert-manager because it is being terminated

Occasionally you might hit the issue as below. It happens when the last KubeVela release deletion hasn't completed.

```
$ vela install
- Installing Vela Core Chart:
install chart vela-core, version 0.1.0, desc : A Helm chart for Kube Vela core, contains 35 file
Failed to install the chart with error: serviceaccounts "cert-manager-cainjector" is forbidden: unable to create new content in namespace cert-manager because it is being terminated
failed to create resource
helm.sh/helm/v3/pkg/kube.(*Client).Update.func1
	/home/runner/go/pkg/mod/helm.sh/helm/v3@v3.2.4/pkg/kube/client.go:190
...
Error: failed to create resource: serviceaccounts "cert-manager-cainjector" is forbidden: unable to create new content in namespace cert-manager because it is being terminated
```

Take a break and try again in a few seconds.

```
$ vela install

And manually apply all WorkloadDefinition and TraitDefinition manifests to have all capabilities back.

```
$ kubectl apply -f charts/vela-core/templates/defwithtemplate

### Error: ScopeDefinition exists

Occasionally you might hit the issue as below. It happens when there is an old OAM Kubernetes Runtime release, or you applied `ScopeDefinition` before.

```
$ vela install
  - Installing Vela Core Chart:
  install chart vela-core, version 0.1.0, desc : A Helm chart for Kube Vela core, contains 35 file

```

Delete `ScopeDefinition` "healthscopes.core.oam.dev" and try again.

```
$ kubectl delete ScopeDefinition "healthscopes.core.oam.dev"
scopedefinition.core.oam.dev "healthscopes.core.oam.dev" deleted

### Warning: capability rollout was not ready

If you hit the issue as below, it means cert-manager is creating a certificate for Trait Rollout.
Just wait a few minutes, and the issue will be self-healed.
