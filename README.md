# KubeVela

KubeVela is a modern application platform that makes deploying and managing applications across today's hybrid, multi-cloud environments easier and faster.

## Features

**Application Centric** - KubeVela introduces declarative yet higher level API (known as [OAM](https://oam.dev/)) to model a full deployment of microservices across hybrid environments in consistent approach. No infrastructure level concerns, simply deploy.

**Natively Extensible** - KubeVela backend is implemented with [CUE](https://cuelang.org/). Whenever your needs grow, KubeVela's capabilities can naturally expand in a IaC-style approach. No restrictions, simply programming.

**Runtime Agnostic** - KubeVela relies on Kubernetes as control plane but it's adaptable to any runtime infrastructures. It can deploy and manage diverse workload types including container, cloud functions, databases, or even EC2 instances across hybrid environments.
