# KubeVela

KubeVela is a modern application engine that exposes higher level API for self-service experience.

## What problems does it solve?

Managing microservices on hybrid infrastructure with constantly changing user requirements is painful. This in turn makes continuous delivery at scale a nearly impossible task.

Hence, as the platform team, we build abstractions to manage such complexity and enforce best practices in the deployment workflow.

However, great in flexibility and extensibility, existing solutions such as IaC (Infrastructure-as-Code) and client-side templating tools all lead to *Configuration Drift* (i.e. the generated instances are not in line with the expected configuration) which is a nightmare in production.

KubeVela solves this by allowing platform teams to manage complexities with IaC, expose abstractions as self-service capabilities, and enforce the consistent standard with [Kubernetes Control Loop](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/architecture/controller/). Rollout model and strategies are also built-in so deployment confidence in hybrid environments is guaranteed.

Think about a *Heroku* fully designed by yourself.

## Getting Started

- [Installation](https://kubevela.io/docs/install)
- [Quick start](https://kubevela.io/docs/quick-start)
- [How it works](https://kubevela.io/docs/concepts)

## Features

- **Robust, repeatable and extensible approach to manage abstractions** - design and enforce best practices with [CUE](https://cuelang.org/) or [Helm](https://helm.sh) templates, ship them to end users with `kubectl`, automatically generating GUI forms for capabilities, and let Kubernetes controller guarantee determinism of the abstractions, no configuration drift.
- **Generic progressive rollout framework** - built-in rollout framework and strategies to upgrade your microservice regardless of its workload type (e.g. stateless, stateful, or even custom operators etc), seamless integration with observability systems.
- **Multi-cluster multi-revision application deployment** - built-in model to deploy or rollout your apps across multiple enviroments and/or clusters, seamless integrated with Service Mesh for traffic shifting. 
- **Simple and Kubernetes native** - KubeVela is just a simple custom controller, all its abstractions and features are defined as [Kubernetes Custom Resources](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/api-extension/custom-resources/) so they naturally work with any CI/CD or GitOps tools.
