*Make shipping applications more enjoyable.*

# KubeVela

KubeVela is the platform engine to create *PaaS-like* experience on Kubernetes, in a scalable approach.

For platform builders, KubeVela serves as a framework that empowers them to create user friendly yet highly extensible platforms at ease.
In details, KubeVela relieves the pains of building such platforms by doing the following:

- Application Centric. KubeVela enforces an **application** concept as its main API and **ALL** KubeVela's capabilities serve
  for the applications' requirements only. This is achieved by adopting the [Open Application Model](https://github.com/oam-dev/spec) 
  as the core API for KubeVela.

- Extending Natively. An application in KubeVela is composed of various modularized components (named: services).
  Capabilities from Kubernetes ecosystem can be added to KubeVela as new workload types or traits through Kubernetes CRD
  registry mechanism at any time.

- Simple yet Extensible Abstraction Mechanism. KubeVela introduced a templating engine (supports [CUELang](https://github.com/cuelang/cue)
  and more) to abstract user-facing schemas from the underlying Kubernetes resources. KubeVela provides a set of
  built-in abstractions to start with and the platform builders are free to modify them at any time.
  Abstraction changes take effect at runtime, neither recompilation nor redeployment of KubeVela is required.

With KubeVela, platform builders now finally have the tooling support to design and ship any new capabilities to their
end-users with high confidence and low turn around time.

For developers, such platforms built with KubeVela will enable them to design and ship their applications to Kubernetes with minimal effort.
Instead of managing a handful infrastructure details, a simple application definition is all they need, following an
developer centric workflow that can be easily integrated with any CI/CD pipeline.
